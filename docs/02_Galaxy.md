Learning Galaxy
===============


There is a nice [screen cast](http://screencast.g2.bx.psu.edu/galaxy101/) that will help introduce how to use the Galaxy server found at https://usegalaxy.org/. The parts about creating a user account won't apply to using the Planemo SDK, as that comes pre-configured with a 'dev' account.


If you have any questions about how to use Galaxy or how to develop tools for it, there is a [Biostars](https://biostar.usegalaxy.org/) page where you can post questions and look for answers.
